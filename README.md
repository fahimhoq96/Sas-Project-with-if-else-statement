# Tasks done
1. Created a new variable for preterm birth that has 2 levels using the weeks gestation variable with values of 1 for preterm and 0 for term. Any baby who had a gestation of strictly less than 37 weeks is considered preterm. Those greater than or equal to 37 weeks are considered term.
2. Using the birth weight variable created a variable that has 3 levels that indicates low, normal, and large birth weights, assigning values of -1 to low, 0 to normal, and 1 to large. Any baby who has a birth weight less than 2500 grams is considered having a low birth weight, any baby who has a birth weight between 2500 and 4000 grams inclusive is considered having a normal birth weight, and any baby greater than 4000 grams is considered having a large birth weight.
3. Made a frequency distribution of all categorical variables, including the 2 new categorical variables created in the first 2 steps.
4. Created a cross tabulation of preterm birth with the following variables: the new birth weight group, sex, prenatal care, and smoking status.
